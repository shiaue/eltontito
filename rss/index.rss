&lt;li&gt;First follow up visit went well, better understood my limitations and the healing process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full mobility without crutches, keep knee at full extension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quad strengthening has been going well, SLRs without brace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leg aches and is sore at night after weightbearing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🙌&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Successful surgery follow-up appointment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convincing the little sister to go to Ignite 🔥&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Handicap parking permit is more clutch than a stick-shift&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This Gameready ❄️machine was and is a GAMECHANGER for my recovery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less than a week and I'm crutches-free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🙏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guatemala mission trip students and the host-families&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continued physical and bodily healing for family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A solution to food intolerances in me and my family&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High schoolers who want to know the Lord&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone affected by the Parkland shooting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who want the spoken word transcript:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are true stories.&lt;br&gt;
May 26th 2003 Aron Ralston was hiking, a boulder fell on his right hand. He waited four days, then amputated his arm with a pocket knife.&lt;br&gt;
On New Year’s Eve, a woman was bungee jumping in Zimbabwe. The cord broke, she then fell into a river and had to swim back to land in crocodile infested waters with a broken collarbone.&lt;br&gt;
Claire Champlin was smashed in the face by a five pound watermelon being propelled by a slingshot.&lt;br&gt;
Matthew Brobst was hit by a javelin.&lt;br&gt;
David Striegl was punched in the mouth. By a kangaroo.&lt;br&gt;
The most amazing part about these stories is when asked about the experience they all smiled, shrugged, and said “I guess things could have been worse.”&lt;br&gt;
So go ahead.&lt;br&gt;
Tell me that you’re having a bad day.&lt;br&gt;
Tell me about the traffic. Tell me about your boss. Tell me about the job you’ve been trying to quit for the past four years. Tell me the morning is just a town house burning to the ground and the snooze button is a fire extinguisher. Tell me the alarm clock stole the keys to your smile, drove it into 7:00 AM, and the crash totaled your happiness.&lt;br&gt;
Tell me! Tell me!&lt;br&gt;
Tell me, how blessed are we to have tragedies so small it can fit on the tips of our tongues?&lt;br&gt;
You see, when Evan lost his legs he was speechless. When my cousin was assaulted, she didn’t speak for forty eight hours. When my uncle was murdered, we had to send out a search party to find my father’s voice.&lt;br&gt;
Most people have no idea that tragedy and silence have the exact same address.&lt;br&gt;
When your day is a museum of disappointments hanging from events that were outside of your control, when you find yourself flailing in an ocean of “Why is this happening to me?”, when it feels like your guardian angel put in his two week notice two months ago and just decided not to tell you, when it feels like God is just a babysitter that’s always on the phone, when you get punched in the esophagus by a fistful of life, remember that every year two million people die of dehydration so it doesn’t matter if the glass is half full or half empty, there’s water in the cup.&lt;br&gt;
Drink it, and stop complaining.&lt;br&gt;
Muscle is created by repeatedly lifting things that have been designed to weigh us down. So when your shoulders feel heavy, stand up straight and lift your chin – call it exercise. When the world crumbles around you, you have to look at the wreckage and then build a new one out of the pieces that are still here.&lt;br&gt;
Remember, you are still here.&lt;br&gt;
The human heart beats approximately four thousand times per hour.&lt;br&gt;
Each pulse, each throb, each palpitation is a trophy engraved with the words “You are still alive”.&lt;br&gt;
You are still alive.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Act like it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpVfcZ0ZcFM"&gt;God's Plan&lt;/a&gt; didn't promise a life without challenges and facing and overcoming challenges is something I think that makes us human. &lt;strong&gt;Every single human in the history of time has faced a challenge.&lt;/strong&gt; It's something we all have in common. No doubt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally think resilience is within every one of us. We just have to choose whether or not we want to persist and persevere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes... this is ANOTHER KNEE SURGERY; but who am I to back down now???&lt;br&gt;
At this point, if I've learned anything it's that I need to stop wasting time complaining, whining,  and feeling sorry / sad / confused / lonely in the worst way about the injury.&lt;br&gt;
It's out of my control and if watching THIS IS US 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 has taught me anything, it's that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life will give you lemons. But there's no lemon so sour that you can't make something resembling lemonade.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of asking first world Americans what poverty is... let's ask those who truly experience it. (Here are some responses, country name in CAPS)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;For a poor person everything is terrible—illness, humiliation, shame. We are cripples; we are afraid of everything; we depend on everyone.

(Here are some responses, country name in CAPS)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;For a poor person everything is terrible—illness, humiliation, shame. We are cripples; we are afraid of everything; we depend on everyone. No one needs us. We are like garbage that everyone wants to get rid of.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
— MOLDOVA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;During the past two years we have not celebrated any holidays with others. We cannot afford to invite anyone to our house and we feel uncomfortable visiting others without bringing a present. The lack of contact leaves one depressed, creates a constant feeling of unhappiness, and a sense of low self-esteem.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
— LATVIA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When one is poor, she has no say in public, she feels inferior. She has no food, so there is famine in her house; no clothing, and no progress in her family.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
— UGANDA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;[The poor have] a feeling of powerlessness and an inability to make themselves heard.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
— CAMEROON&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Your hunger is never satisfied, your thirst is never quenched; you can never sleep until you are no longer tired.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
— SENEGAL&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What determines poverty or well-being? The indigenous people's destiny is to be poor.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
— ECUADOR&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poor define poverty as more than lack of material possessions.&lt;br&gt;
It is conditions more psychological and social then what we think: shame, inferiority, powerlessness, humiliation, fear, hopelessness, depression, social isolation, voicelessness, personal worthlessness, and social despair&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We in the US tend to emphasize poverty as a lack of material things.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Analogy&lt;/strong&gt;: Going to the doctor to treat an illness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doctor can misdiagnose the illness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doctor can merely try to reduce the symptoms (Mucinex)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ifpovertyissolution"&gt;If poverty is...  -&amp;gt;      Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lack of knowledge -&amp;gt; education&lt;br&gt;
Oppression by the powerful -&amp;gt; social justice&lt;br&gt;
The personal sins of the poor -&amp;gt; evangelism and discipleship of the poor&lt;br&gt;
Lack of material resources -&amp;gt; give $$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, simply giving money will do more harm than good because it doesn't get to the root cause of poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poverty alleviation efforts should be multifaceted as well&lt;br&gt;
Human beings are spiritual, social, psychological, and physical beings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our basic predisposition toward poor communities (people, organizations, institutions, culture) should include the notion that they are part of the good world that Christ created and is sustaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; bringing Christ to poor communities for the very first time. He has been active in these communities since the creation of the world.&lt;br&gt;
A significant part of working in these poorer communities involves discovering and appreciating what God has been doing there for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects of the fall are manifested in the economic, social, religious, and political systems that humans have created throughout history&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Poverty is the result of relationships that do not work, that are not just, that are not for life, that are not harmonious or enjoyable. Poverty is the absence of shalom in all its meanings&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
-Myers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still inherent goodness  as Christ &amp;quot;holds all things together&amp;quot; and to &amp;quot;sustain all things by his powerful word&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="whoarethepoor"&gt;WHO ARE THE POOR?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every human being is poor in the sense of not experiencing these four relationships in the way that God intended.&lt;br&gt;
We are all suffering from a poverty of spiritual intimacy, community, and stewardship&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Until we recognize and embrace our mutual brokenness, our work with low-income people is likely to do more harm than good.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shame called &amp;quot;poverty of being&amp;quot; is a major part of the brokenness that low-income people experience in their relationship with themselves. They feel inferior to others. This paralyzes the poor from taking initiative and seizing opportunities to improve their situation. &lt;strong&gt;They don't see them as children of God, highly valued, and sought after by the King Himself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the1stworldgodcomplex"&gt;The 1st World &amp;quot;God-Complex&amp;quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economically rich, higher-income population also suffers from the poverty of being.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;quot;God-complex&amp;quot;:  subtle and unconscious sense of superiority in which they believe that they have achieved their wealth through their own efforts and that they have been anointed to decide what is best for low-income people, whom they view as inferior to themselves&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you know you have a “god-complex”?&lt;br&gt;
Why do you really want to help the poor?&lt;br&gt;
Does it feel good to help those with less? It’s common to unintentionally reduce poor people to objects to fulfill a need to accomplish something “good” or “noble”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the biggest problems in many poverty-alleviation efforts is that their design and implementation exacerbates the poverty of being of the economically rich (their god-complexes) and the poverty of being of the economically poor (their feelings of inferiority and shame)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way we act towards the economically poor often communicates that we are superior and they are inferior.&lt;br&gt;
When this problem is ignored, the shame and inferiority in the economically poor increase AND &amp;quot;compassion fatigue&amp;quot; (decreased willingness to help, increased disdain for those that are being helped) begins to develop in those trying to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Material definition of poverty + God-complexes of materially non-poor + Feelings of inferiority of materially poor = Harm to both materially poor and non-poor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By showing low-income people through our words, actions, and most importantly our ears that they are people with unique gifts and abilities, we can be part of helping them to recover their sense of dignity, even as we recover from our sense of pride.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="healthandwealthgospel"&gt;Health and Wealth Gospel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We in America have sufficient buffers in place to shield us from most economic shocks.&lt;br&gt;
We don't really &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to trust God's sovereignty just to get us through the day.&lt;br&gt;
Health and wealth gospel teaches that God rewards increasing levels of faith with greater amounts of wealth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This is COMPLETE BS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="weareallpoorandbroken"&gt;WE ARE ALL POOR AND BROKEN&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That being said, the economically poor face a unique set of struggles:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Vulnerability, powerlessness, isolation, physical weakness, helplessness, anxiety, suffocation, desperation unparalleled in the lives of the rest of humanity.&lt;br&gt;
Lack of freedom to be able to make meaningful choices to affect one's situation&lt;/p&gt;

Not horrible, but also not comfortable at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw the sun for the first time today in 3 days... haven't left the house since surgery.&lt;br&gt;
What a time to be alive.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The highlight of my day was witnessing this MAGIC 🎩&lt;br&gt;
AKA DRY SHAMPOO (🙌 shoutout to Vivi, you know who you are)&lt;br&gt;

The &amp;quot;Death&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;Death Valley&amp;quot; better be referring to the death of the dandruff in my hair...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to use dry shampoo (I didn't know until today)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Point and spray directly on front and near roots (10 inches away from hair)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait a minute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Massage it in&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psalm 23 resonated with me and also with this dry shampoo 😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is with me through the hills and the valleys, in the victories and the suffering. I know this in my head, but I need to truly take it to heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=""&gt;🙌&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Dry shampoo is a gift from God&lt;/li&gt;

Which is why I have to be very intentional about doing things that cause pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each leg movement sends ripples of pain through my leg.&lt;br&gt;
Thankfully, it is tolerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got in 4 sets of rehab in today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No need for pain meds, hopefully it's downhill from here&lt;br&gt;
The less I rely on drugs, the better in tune I am with my body and the recovery&lt;/p&gt;

But it's like going on a roller coaster for the first time... scary, painful, but after you do it once; every time afterwards is less scary and less painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah... with my experience, definitely less painful this time around.&lt;/p&gt;

Ready for surgery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;14:55&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Wheeled into operating room&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;16:40&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Approximate wake up time&lt;br&gt;
My fastest wake up time after an operation... Interesting&lt;br&gt;
I IMMEDIATELY tried to raise my surgery leg to see if the doctor was able to do &lt;a href="http://eltontito.me/the-verdict/"&gt;Surgery 1&lt;/a&gt; which attempts to repair my meniscus rather than just shaving it.&lt;br&gt;
Longer recovery, but prolongs the usage of my knees.&lt;br&gt;
I have never been so happy to have trouble / pain trying to lift my knee. If option 2 was done, then I would be walking out of the hospital and rehab would be a piece of cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a trade-off...&lt;br&gt;
Short-term, instant gratification vs. Long term benefit... Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;19:00&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
First meal of the day. 4 bowls of rice porridge &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congee"&gt;(Congee)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Fasting was only bad when I thought about it.&lt;br&gt;
Weight bearing with brace on full lock (no flexion) was not a problem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like Mr. Incredible with this anesthesia coursing through my veins 💪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nerves are not feeling much... yet 😬&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can walk without the crutches and just with the brace...&lt;br&gt;
SLR are doable without pain.&lt;br&gt;
Quad contractions are present (minimal but present)&lt;br&gt;
Am I delusional???&lt;br&gt;
Will the pain kick in tomorrow???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess we'll see 👀😉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id="praise"&gt;🙌 Praise:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surgery 1 was a success! That means my menisus was repaired, and my ACL is intact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fam for taking me to and from hospital&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Received my first laptop donation for &lt;a href="http://eltontito.me/phase-0-preparation"&gt;Phase 0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="prayerrequests"&gt;🙏 Prayer Requests:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patience throughout the process. Through the recovery, with my body, with myself. They say &amp;quot;God's timing is perfect&amp;quot; and I still need to wrap my mind around that fully.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pray for no complications. Any health delays could jeapordize Phase 1 of my mission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pray that &lt;a href="http://eltontito.me/phase-0-preparation"&gt;Phase 0&lt;/a&gt; gets completed and that we receive plenty of laptops to bring to Guatemala.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id="possibleoutcomes"&gt;Possible Outcomes:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Surgery 1:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Repair the meniscus&lt;br&gt;
++ No increased risk of arthritis&lt;br&gt;
-- Longer, more extensive rehab (3+ months)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Surgery 2:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Shave most of meniscus off&lt;br&gt;
++ Faster recovery (2-4 weeks)&lt;br&gt;
-- Risk of long-time problems with knee (arthritis)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id="thekicker"&gt;The Kicker:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no choice of the surgery option... (Oh the uncertainty)&lt;br&gt;
Surgeon will try for &lt;code&gt;Surgery 1&lt;/code&gt;, but if the repair doesn't hold, they will fall back to &lt;code&gt;Surgery 2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="potentialcomplications"&gt;Potential Complications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ACL is in fact torn (MRI usually doesn't lie... but the camera will reveal the FACTS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infection post surgery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep vein thrombosis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="prayerrequests"&gt;🙏 Prayer Requests:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Staying locked in throughout another round of rehab.&lt;br&gt;
To be focused on my mission to serve God in Guateamala and learn something new each day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This &amp;quot;suffering&amp;quot; I'm currently in is just a state of mind... just like the physical pain that comes with it. I can choose isolate and dwell.. OR I can choose not to&lt;br&gt;
Haven't we already been liberated from the prison that we lock ourselves in???&lt;br&gt;
Jesus doesn't have the key... HE IS THE 🔑&lt;br&gt;
It's time to use this process to read more, learn more, and glorify God more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; let physical pain give me a reason to treat others with less kindness, love, and patience. Everyone and their mother is dealing with some sort of pain. Complaining about my wound(s) does nothing to heal yours and vice versa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swift and steady recovery (I really hope this is my last knee surgery... that is all)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Those who try to keep their lives will lose them. But those who give up their lives will save them.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
Luke 17:33&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a rawness and a wonder to life. Pursue it. Hunt for it. Sell out to get it. Don't listen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://localhost:2368/why-guatemala-why-now/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5a876d56e1fe69592f566653</guid><category>Guatemala</category><category>Jesus</category><dc:creator>E</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 16 Feb 2018 23:48:35 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/02/cameron-wilkins-487426.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class="kg-card-markdown"&gt;&lt;h2 id="thevoiceofadventure"&gt;The Voice of Adventure&lt;/h2&gt;

Luke 17:33&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a rawness and a wonder to life. Pursue it. Hunt for it. Sell out to get it. Don't listen to the whines of those who have settled for a second-rate life and want you to do the same so they won't feel guilty. Your goal is not to love long; it's to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus says the options are clear. On one side there is the voice of safety. You can build a fire in the hearth, stay inside, and stay warm and dry and safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you can hear the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;voice of adventure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; - God's adventure. Instead of building a fire in your hearth, build a fire in your heart. Follow God's impulses. Adopt the child. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move overseas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Teach the class. Change careers. Run for office. Make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure it isn't safe, but what is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id="guatemala"&gt;Guatemala&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm getting too comfortable with the tech life in Silicon Valley&lt;br&gt;
People who are comfortable don't need Jesus, that's called PRIDE.&lt;br&gt;
According to Bob Goff, we need to live on the edge of our comfort zones; Living right on the edge of the &amp;quot;YIKES&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
God is the only true comforter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have an opportunity to directly help those in Guatemala with my technology skills. Years of computer science and helping my friends and family with technology issues have finally paid off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The opportunity to lead a group of high schoolers the first week of my mission trip. I've never really thought of myself as a leader, but this is my chance to share some of the many lessons I have learned from failing and falling short.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willow Creek Church's 10 year partnership with a clinic in Guatemala.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spanish - the name of the blog, my phone language for the past 5 years, Spanish - only - in - the - living - room last year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Estoy listo. En serio, he estado preparando para esta oportunidad desde mi viaje a Costa Rica en 2013.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whynow"&gt;Why Now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a break before full-time work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am ready to carry out &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://eltontito.me/la-mision"&gt;La Misión&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;God's voice of adventure is calling me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="prayerrequests"&gt;Prayer Requests:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knee Injury - ability to move in Guatemala&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diet - obtaining necessary food in Guatemala&lt;/li&gt;

I have already torn both ACLs (2015, 2016)&lt;br&gt;
Another knee surgery in 3/2017 to clean up my meniscus...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="andnowthis"&gt;AND NOW THIS??? 😩😢😭🤕&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Deets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;02/14/18 22:00&lt;/code&gt; Bad cut while playing pickup basketball&lt;br&gt;
I felt the shooting pain right away. Limited weight bearing as well&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;02/15/18 00:42&lt;/code&gt; Thursday Morning...&lt;br&gt;
Potentially tore my ACL.. AGAIN...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancelled my flight to Linger Conference (I need Jesus more than ever right now) and going straight home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T-5 hours until I leave for the airport...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOW IN THE WORLD DID I GET HERE???&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Previously that day...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Just saw Riley Lachance hit a buzzer beater 3 for Vanderbilt Basketball to get the W vs MSS.&lt;br&gt;
Got to see Zach Hamer, Damian, Djery&lt;br&gt;
It was all good...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I decided to go play basketball...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do you do this to yourself...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing pickup basketball is never a good idea. And I was &amp;quot;trying&amp;quot; a little too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current status:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;h2 id="heroesnotallsuperheroeswearcapes"&gt;Heroes (not all superheroes wear capes):&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patty J, Bo Kim, Isaiah Salazar for loving me in the face of my adversity; for literally carrying me from the gym to the car and to towers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Djery for providing me with food and shelter last night&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aron, Fletcher, Robby, Matt Bedard, Jake Steins, Faith Noah, Chris Romanoski, Peter Kim, Matt Sentilles, and the whole UCAT / Fratican community for helping me get ice, helping me get into the shower, and loving me as I attempted to do anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logan Guy (Obama) and Parker Ragle (Biden) for supporting me through this time of adversity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My parents for having to see me injured once again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lovely lady, who works for American Airlines customer service, who helped me fly directly home tomorrow without having to pay an arm and a leg. God Bless your sweet soul Rachel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SARA MELBY... Athletic trainer and superwoman. What an incredibly kind human. For responding to my text and advising me how to proceed. I don't know how I'll ever thank you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="prayerrequests"&gt;🙏 Prayer Requests:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supernatural healing in my knee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can still serve in Guatemala in some capacity despite my injury&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I never play basketball again...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was praying to God that I would find a way to leave my comfort zone... so now I'm REALLY uncomfortable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peace, Gratitude, Trust in the Lord because Romans 8:28 says:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are reading this... Either you've had your ACL repaired or will have your ACL repaired.&lt;br&gt;
... Or you are one of my blessed friends with strong ACLs 💪&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is definitely a long road ahead, I can assure you it is not a road less traveled. &lt;a href="http://www.theaclclub.com/pages/about-the-club"&gt;(Check out the official ACL Club)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those on the rehab journey or about to embark on one...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id="herearesomeofmyprotips"&gt;Here are some of my &lt;strong&gt;PRO TIPS&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h4 id="1donotcompareyourrecoverytimelinewiththatofothers"&gt;1. Do &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; compare your recovery timeline with that of others.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teddy Roosevelt said that &amp;quot;Comparison is the thief of joy&amp;quot; and in this case it is also the thief of a healthy and stable recovery as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, &lt;a href="http://localhost:2368/welcome-to-the-acl-club/(http://www.startribune.com/chart-adrian-peterson-2012-timeline/184523291/)"&gt;Adrian Peterson&lt;/a&gt; was running in 12 weeks and doing NFL level workouts in 5 months... but not all knees were created equally. Comparing my timeline with AP's does nothing...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don't have his surgery, rehabilitation protocol, body composition, and 24/7 training staff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id="2setrehabgoalsforyourself"&gt;2. Set rehab goals for yourself&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just because you aren't comparing to others doesn't mean you can't set goals for your rehabilitation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell yourself you are going to increase your ROM by &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; degrees this week
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do those leg raises without the brace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walk a lap on the track&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single leg balance for the first time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id="3dontthinkofpainasabadthing"&gt;3. Don't think of &lt;em&gt;PAIN&lt;/em&gt; as a &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;bad&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; thing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Especially when you are &lt;em&gt;cranking&lt;/em&gt; those heel slides out... remember how crucial ROM is in your life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want full ROM again, just keep pulling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id="4redefineyourdefinitionoffailure"&gt;4. Redefine Your Definition of &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Failure&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failure is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; lifting less weight than you used to lift when you were healthy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failure is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; running / walking / moving slower than you did pre-op&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let's be honest here, the only real failure is when you don't feel like doing your PT exercises or start dwelling on the things that your body currently cannot physically do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id="5trackyourprogress"&gt;5. Track Your Progress&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regardless if it's a diary, journal, blog, ... etc.&lt;br&gt;
What's important is that you are tracking your journey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This allows you to look back and reflect on the lessons you learned from rehab &lt;em&gt;(I know you learned &lt;strong&gt;something&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This also allows you to see how far you've come (And boy is it amazing to see your strength double in nearly a week)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id="6changehowyoumeasuresuccess"&gt;6. Change How You Measure Success&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop measuring your &amp;quot;success&amp;quot; by what you can or can't do. (Somethings take longer to do than others)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measure your success by &lt;strong&gt;effort&lt;/strong&gt;, it's something you have 100% control over&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id="7attitudeiseverything"&gt;7. Attitude is &lt;strong&gt;EVERYTHING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Studies have shown that a bad attitude affects more aspects of your live than just your rehab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here are 3 sources that back me up

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://news.health.com/2015/06/26/can-negative-thinking-make-you-sick/"&gt;Can Negative Thinking Make You Sick?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you fully believe that today you will be at least 1% stronger than you were yesterday, what's stopping you from doing just that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id="8learnsomethingnew"&gt;8. Learn Something New&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What better time to start something new then when life throws you a curveball.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suggestions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading (non-academic, books you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to read... yes, those do exist)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biking (This is the first high intensity cardio you will most likely be cleared to do)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swimming (Once you are cleared to swim, it's no impact and great cardio)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn an instrument (As long as it doesn't require your recovering leg)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn a new language (You can learn almost any language online now, check out my favorite site, &lt;a href="http://www.duolingo.com"&gt;Duolingo&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take time to enjoy something that you wouldn't have done if you didn't get hurt. Because that way, you will have learned / done something that without your injury you would have never learned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id="9celebratethelittlevictoriesfollowingupon2"&gt;9. Celebrate the Little Victories &lt;em&gt;(Following up on #2.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As it should be with anything in life, be sure to enjoy and celebrate the little achievements.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Whether it be a few more degrees of ROM, or your first time walking without crutches / brace, or even your first pain-free lap around the track... &lt;br&gt;A win is a &lt;strong&gt;win&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id="10practicegratitude"&gt;10. Practice Gratitude&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wholeheartedly believe gratitude is the only way to open the door to true joy and happiness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don't take my word for it, here are some &lt;a href="http://localhost:2368/welcome-to-the-acl-club/(http://eat-spin-run-repeat.com/2015/10/12/8-inspiring-ted-talks-on-gratitude/)"&gt;TED Talks&lt;/a&gt; that reveal the truth and power behind gratitude&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Life changing gratitude does not fasten to a life unless nailed through with one very specific nail at a time&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The whole of the life -- even the hard -- is made up of the minute parts, and if I miss the infinitesimals, I miss the whole. These are new language lessons, and I live them out. There is a way to live the big of giving thanks in all things. It is this: to give thanks in this one small thing. The moments will add up.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6 a.m. and your hand can’t make it to the alarm clock before the voices in your head start telling you that it’s too early, too dark, and too cold to get out of bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aching muscles lie still in rebellion, pretending not to hear your brain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://localhost:2368/grit-and-grind/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5a7d3fa67bd76cf0d1ee54b8</guid><category>Rehab 💪</category><dc:creator>E</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2016 05:28:00 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/02/wynand-van-poortvliet-42130.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class="kg-card-markdown"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src="http://localhost:2368/content/images/2018/02/wynand-van-poortvliet-42130.jpg" alt="Grit and Grind"&gt;&lt;p&gt;6 a.m. and your hand can’t make it to the alarm clock before the voices in your head start telling you that it’s too early, too dark, and too cold to get out of bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aching muscles lie still in rebellion, pretending not to hear your brain commanding them to move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A legion of voices are shouting their unanimous permission for you to hit the snooze button and go back to dreamland&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you didn’t ask their opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The voice you’ve chosen to listen to is one of defiance. A voice that says there was a reason you set that alarm in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So sit up, put your feet on the floor, and don’t look back because we’ve got work to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to The Grind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For what is each day but a series of conflicts between the right way, and the easy way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10,000 streams fan out like a river delta before you, each one promising the path of least resistance. Thing is…you’re headed upstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when you make that choice, when you decide to turn your back on what’s comfortable, and safe, and what some would call “common sense,” well that’s Day One. From there it only gets tougher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So just make sure this is something you want, because the easy way out will always be there, ready to wash you away. All you have to do is pick up your feet…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you aren’t going to, are you? With each step comes the decision to take another. You’re on your way now, but this is no time to dwell on how far you’ve come. You’re in a fight against an opponent you can’t see, but oh, you can feel him on your heels, can’t ya? Feel him breathing down your neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know what that is? That’s you. Your fears, your doubts and insecurities all lined up like a firing squad ready to shoot you out of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t lose heart. While they are not easily defeated, they are far from invincible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, this is The Grind. The battle royale between you and your mind, your body, and the devil on your shoulder who’s telling you that, “This is just a game. This is just a waste of time. Your opponents are stronger than you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drown out the voice of uncertainty with the sound of your own heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burn away your self-doubt with a fire lit beneath you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember what we are fighting for, and never forget that momentum is a cruel mistress. She can turn on a dime at the smallest mistake. She is ever searching for the weak place in your armor, that one tiny thing that you forgot to prepare for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as long as the devil is hiding in the details, the question remains: Is that all you got?…Are you sure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when the answer is “Yes,” when you’ve done all you can to prepare yourself for battle, then it’s time to go forth and boldly face your enemy. The enemy within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only now, you must take that fight into the open. Into hostile territory. You’re a lion in a field of lions, all hunting the same elusive prey with a desperate starvation that says, “Victory is the only thing that can keep you alive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So believe that voice that says: You can run a little faster. And you can throw a little harder. And that for you, the laws of physics are merely a suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luck is the last dying wish of those who want to believe that winning can happen by accident. Sweat, on the other hand, is for those who know it’s a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So decide now, because destiny waits for no man. And when your time comes, and a thousand different voices are trying to tell you, “You’re not ready for it,” listen instead to that lone voice of dissent. That one that says, “You are ready. You are prepared.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s all up to you now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So rise and shine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started this post 2-months ago, but I couldn't quite think of what I could possibly add to the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNL_DAI19_I"&gt;bold declaration above&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on my physical rehab journey, the 2016 NBA Finals (😢 Chef Curry), and my taste of work life, I have noticed that the &amp;quot;grind&amp;quot; only makes life more whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joy, the fun, the laughs... and the human experienece itself all come from giving it all you got.&lt;br&gt;
Whether it's that last lap in the pool, the final turn on the track, or even that final task you want to finish before leaving the office, just lock-in, anchor down, and do your best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you look back at the years and can only recall yourself giving only half of yourself, it's the worst feeling ever. Regret. Shame. Disappointment. Depression. Fear. One or more may fill your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, let those experiences remind you that you have so much more within yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only disability in life is a bad attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
