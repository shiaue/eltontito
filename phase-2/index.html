<p>"Those who try to keep their lives will lose them. But those who give up their lives will save them."<br>
Luke 17:33</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a rawness and a wonder to life. Pursue it. Hunt for it. Sell out to get it. Don't listen to the whines of those who have settled for a second-rate life and want you to do the same so they won't feel guilty. Your goal is not to live long; it's to live.<br>
Jesus says the options are clear. On one side there is the voice of safety. You can build a fire in the hearth, stay inside, and stay warm and dry and safe.<br>
Or you can hear the voice of adventure - God's adventure. Instead of building a fire in your hearth, build a fire in your heart. Follow God's impulses.  Move overseas. Teach the class. Change careers. Make a difference.<br>
<strong>Sure it isn't safe, but what is?</strong></p>

<h3 id="whyguatemala">Why Guatemala?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Willow Creek Community Church has a partnership with Association Vida, a clinic in Guatemala. Having witnessed this partnership firsthand, I want nothing more than to be a part of it and to help strengthen the relationships between Willow Creek and Guatemala.</li>
<li>I was absolutely blown away by Guatemala last month when I went as a high school leader. <a href="http://eltontito.me/phase-1">(Read more about the Phase 1 trip here)</a></li>
<li>Guatemala will only fuel my passion for Spanish. (see below for more on Spanish)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="whyme">Why Me?</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have a genuine passion for Spanish. After my limited and broken Spanish failed me when I served as a student in Costa Rica (2013), I realized the importance of spoken languages to communicate, to love, and to more effectively serve others.<br>
Furthermore, I <strong>LOVE</strong> Spanish and I have spoken or messaged in Spanish nearly every day for the past few years. (I even convinced some homies to message with me in Spanish on Whatsapp üòÅ)<br>
My favorite Spanish TV shows are "Casa de Papeles" and "La Ni√±a". I have been very intentional about practicing to the point where I convinced my roommates last year to only speak Spanish when we were in our living room.<br>
I love the music, the culture, the dance. I even performed the merengue (Dominican Republic style dance) at a Hispanic student dance festival last year. <em>message me if you want to watch me make a fool of myself</em></li>
<li>I was getting too comfortable with my life in Silicon Valley and people who are comfortable don't need Jesus. According to one of my favorite authors, Bob Goff, ‚ÄúWe need to live on the edge of our comfort zones; living right on the edge of the ‚ÄúYIKES‚Äù. In fact, I want to live outside my comfort zone to the point where comfort becomes a foreign to me. I don‚Äôt say this just because I love challenges, but because Jesus is the only true comfort in life. Nothing else has eternal value.</li>
<li>After years of studying technology and helping my friends and family with tech problems, I will finally have a way to take what I learned to serve others directly. I get to be a missionary. This is the dream: to worship God with the specific passions and gifts He gave me.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whynowjune2018">Why Now? (June 2018):</h3>
<p>The timing couldn‚Äôt be more perfect. I have the technology skills fresh in my mind from working and have been working on an education curriculum and methodology with a friend for the past 5 months. This curriculum involves including memory techniques to help students retain information for longer<br>
Phase 1, the high school mission trip to Guatemala, not only exceeded all of my expectations, but I was also able to successfully assess the need to return and carry out this trip. The medical clinic could use my assistance and I was able to learn about the technology education, or lack thereof, in Guatemala.</p>
<h3 id="themission">The Mission</h3>
<p><strong>Teach</strong>: I am partnering with local organizations to create a computer lab with the goal to bringing over 30 laptops (Donated from local organizations and friends) for students. As much as I would love to teach Guatemalan students directly, I believe it would be more effective and sustainable to teach Guatemalan teachers and professors. This will allow for consistent communication and minimize the risk for the teaching to be lost as students become adults. My goal is to teach the professors how to maintain the laptops as well as developing a curriculum that makes it easy for Guatemalan students to learn but also challenges them to learn more like the American college system did for me.</p>
<p>There currently aren't any working computer science education opportunities for the students in Guatemala.<br>
The government has a weekly program that is expensive and only provides students with 30-60min of computer time once a week!<br>
(No one can learn from so little computer time)</p>
<p>The premise behind this mission is to expose the Guatemalan students to programming and give them the opportunity and resources to learn. (Just like I was given in college)</p>
<p><strong>Serve</strong>: I will implement a cloud based solution to synchronize patient records at the the medical clinic. Currently, there is nothing to connect the patient data from the clinic, laboratory, and pharmacy. I am hoping to use their internet and a software solution to connect the patient database.<br>
Also, I will also help translate for the Willow Creek Family Mission trip that will be there at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Love</strong>: When I am not teaching or working at the clinic, I will do everything I can to find extravagant ways to love the Guatemalans from the church community to my host family and evenyone in between. Again, Bob Goff says it best, "When we are fearlessly engaging with world with a child-like faith, it gives those around us the green light to do so too."</p>
<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p>To avoid the possibility of taxes, tariffs, confiscation, suspicion, or questioning from the Guatemalan customs (all possible outcomes from bringing one luggage full of laptops across international borders)</p>
<p>The plan is to distribute these laptops among the family mission trip members to get them across the border. An adult bringing 1-2 laptops shouldn't raise any eyebrows.</p>
<p>Once in Guatemala, laptops will be configured for their purpose.<br>
<strong>This trip kicks off on June 18, 2018.</strong></p>
