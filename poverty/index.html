<p>Instead of asking first world Americans what poverty is... let's ask those who truly experience it. (Here are some responses, country name in CAPS)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For a poor person everything is terrible—illness, humiliation, shame. We are cripples; we are afraid of everything; we depend on everyone. No one needs us. We are like garbage that everyone wants to get rid of."<br>
— MOLDOVA</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"During the past two years we have not celebrated any holidays with others. We cannot afford to invite anyone to our house and we feel uncomfortable visiting others without bringing a present. The lack of contact leaves one depressed, creates a constant feeling of unhappiness, and a sense of low self-esteem."<br>
— LATVIA</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"When one is poor, she has no say in public, she feels inferior. She has no food, so there is famine in her house; no clothing, and no progress in her family."<br>
— UGANDA</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"[The poor have] a feeling of powerlessness and an inability to make themselves heard."<br>
— CAMEROON</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Your hunger is never satisfied, your thirst is never quenched; you can never sleep until you are no longer tired."<br>
— SENEGAL</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"What determines poverty or well-being? The indigenous people's destiny is to be poor."<br>
— ECUADOR</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The poor define poverty as more than lack of material possessions.<br>
It is conditions more psychological and social then what we think: shame, inferiority, powerlessness, humiliation, fear, hopelessness, depression, social isolation, voicelessness, personal worthlessness, and social despair</p>
<p>We in the US tend to emphasize poverty as a lack of material things.<br>
<strong>Analogy</strong>: Going to the doctor to treat an illness</p>
<ol>
<li>Doctor can misdiagnose the illness</li>
<li>Doctor can merely try to reduce the symptoms (Mucinex)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="ifpovertyissolution">If poverty is...  -&gt;      Solution</h3>
<p>Lack of knowledge -&gt; education<br>
Oppression by the powerful -&gt; social justice<br>
The personal sins of the poor -&gt; evangelism and discipleship of the poor<br>
Lack of material resources -&gt; give $$$</p>
<p>Most of the time, simply giving money will do more harm than good because it doesn't get to the root cause of poverty.</p>
<p>Poverty alleviation efforts should be multifaceted as well<br>
Human beings are spiritual, social, psychological, and physical beings</p>
<p>Our basic predisposition toward poor communities (people, organizations, institutions, culture) should include the notion that they are part of the good world that Christ created and is sustaining.</p>
<p>We are <strong>NOT</strong> bringing Christ to poor communities for the very first time. He has been active in these communities since the creation of the world.<br>
A significant part of working in these poorer communities involves discovering and appreciating what God has been doing there for a long time.</p>
<p>The effects of the fall are manifested in the economic, social, religious, and political systems that humans have created throughout history</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Poverty is the result of relationships that do not work, that are not just, that are not for life, that are not harmonious or enjoyable. Poverty is the absence of shalom in all its meanings"<br>
-Myers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is still inherent goodness  as Christ "holds all things together" and to "sustain all things by his powerful word"</p>
<h3 id="whoarethepoor">WHO ARE THE POOR?</h3>
<p>Every human being is poor in the sense of not experiencing these four relationships in the way that God intended.<br>
We are all suffering from a poverty of spiritual intimacy, community, and stewardship</p>
<p><strong>Until we recognize and embrace our mutual brokenness, our work with low-income people is likely to do more harm than good.</strong></p>
<p>A shame called "poverty of being" is a major part of the brokenness that low-income people experience in their relationship with themselves. They feel inferior to others. This paralyzes the poor from taking initiative and seizing opportunities to improve their situation. <strong>They don't see them as children of God, highly valued, and sought after by the King Himself.</strong></p>
<h3 id="the1stworldgodcomplex">The 1st World "God-Complex"</h3>
<p>The economically rich, higher-income population also suffers from the poverty of being.<br>
"God-complex":  subtle and unconscious sense of superiority in which they believe that they have achieved their wealth through their own efforts and that they have been anointed to decide what is best for low-income people, whom they view as inferior to themselves</p>
<p>How do you know you have a “god-complex”?<br>
Why do you really want to help the poor?<br>
Does it feel good to help those with less? It’s common to unintentionally reduce poor people to objects to fulfill a need to accomplish something “good” or “noble”.</p>
<p><strong>One of the biggest problems in many poverty-alleviation efforts is that their design and implementation exacerbates the poverty of being of the economically rich (their god-complexes) and the poverty of being of the economically poor (their feelings of inferiority and shame)</strong></p>
<p>The way we act towards the economically poor often communicates that we are superior and they are inferior.<br>
When this problem is ignored, the shame and inferiority in the economically poor increase AND "compassion fatigue" (decreased willingness to help, increased disdain for those that are being helped) begins to develop in those trying to help.</p>
<p><strong>Equation</strong><br>
Material definition of poverty + God-complexes of materially non-poor + Feelings of inferiority of materially poor = Harm to both materially poor and non-poor</p>
<p><strong>By showing low-income people through our words, actions, and most importantly our ears that they are people with unique gifts and abilities, we can be part of helping them to recover their sense of dignity, even as we recover from our sense of pride.</strong></p>
<h3 id="healthandwealthgospel">Health and Wealth Gospel</h3>
<p>We in America have sufficient buffers in place to shield us from most economic shocks.<br>
We don't really <em><strong>need</strong></em> to trust God's sovereignty just to get us through the day.<br>
Health and wealth gospel teaches that God rewards increasing levels of faith with greater amounts of wealth.<br>
<strong>This is COMPLETE BS</strong></p>
<h3 id="weareallpoorandbroken">WE ARE ALL POOR AND BROKEN</h3>
<p><strong>That being said, the economically poor face a unique set of struggles:</strong><br>
Vulnerability, powerlessness, isolation, physical weakness, helplessness, anxiety, suffocation, desperation unparalleled in the lives of the rest of humanity.<br>
Lack of freedom to be able to make meaningful choices to affect one's situation</p>
