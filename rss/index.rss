Spend a few minutes each day planning, reflecting, and asking, "What's standing in my way?"&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work toward clearly defined short-term goals. Breaking big goals into short-term goals that are time-boxed will help create a sense of accomplishment and move you forward.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sprint—stay focused on your goal. Block out times of the day when you can work free from distraction until you reach your goal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taken from the &lt;strong&gt;Agile Scrum&lt;/strong&gt; framework commonly used in software engineering.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/scrum-life"&gt;Scrum for life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/how-i-work-and-use-scrum-personally"&gt;How I Work, and Use Scrum Personally&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://techbeacon.com/personal-scrum-using-agile-techniques-manage-your-life"&gt;Personal Scrum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/featured/scrum-for-one.html"&gt;Scrum for One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a rawness and a wonder to life. Pursue it. Hunt for it. Sell out to get it. Don't listen to the whines of those who have settled for a second-rate life and want you to do the same so they won't feel guilty. Your goal is not to live long; it's to live.&lt;br&gt;
Jesus says the options are clear. On one side there is the voice of safety. You can build a fire in the hearth, stay inside, and stay warm and dry and safe.&lt;br&gt;
Or you can hear the voice of adventure - God's adventure. Instead of building a fire in your hearth, build a fire in your heart. Follow God's impulses.  Move overseas. Teach the class. Change careers. Make a difference.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Sure it isn't safe, but what is?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id="whyguatemala"&gt;Why Guatemala?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Willow Creek Community Church has a partnership with Association Vida, a clinic in Guatemala. Having witnessed this partnership firsthand, I want nothing more than to be a part of it and to help strengthen the relationships between Willow Creek and Guatemala.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was absolutely blown away by Guatemala last month when I went as a high school leader. &lt;a href="http://eltontito.me/phase-1"&gt;(Read more about the Phase 1 trip here)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guatemala will only fuel my passion for Spanish. (see below for more on Spanish)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id="whyme"&gt;Why Me?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a genuine passion for Spanish. After my limited and broken Spanish failed me when I served as a student in Costa Rica (2013), I realized the importance of spoken languages to communicate, to love, and to more effectively serve others.&lt;br&gt;
Furthermore, I &lt;strong&gt;LOVE&lt;/strong&gt; Spanish and I have spoken or messaged in Spanish nearly every day for the past few years. (I even convinced some homies to message with me in Spanish on Whatsapp 😁)&lt;br&gt;
My favorite Spanish TV shows are &amp;quot;Casa de Papeles&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;La Niña&amp;quot;. I have been very intentional about practicing to the point where I convinced my roommates last year to only speak Spanish when we were in our living room.&lt;br&gt;
I love the music, the culture, the dance. I even performed the merengue (Dominican Republic style dance) at a Hispanic student dance festival last year. &lt;em&gt;message me if you want to watch me make a fool of myself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was getting too comfortable with my life in Silicon Valley and people who are comfortable don't need Jesus. According to one of my favorite authors, Bob Goff, “We need to live on the edge of our comfort zones; living right on the edge of the “YIKES”. In fact, I want to live outside my comfort zone to the point where comfort becomes a foreign to me. I don’t say this just because I love challenges, but because Jesus is the only true comfort in life. Nothing else has eternal value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After years of studying technology and helping my friends and family with tech problems, I will finally have a way to take what I learned to serve others directly. I get to be a missionary. This is the dream: to worship God with the specific passions and gifts He gave me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="whynowjune2018"&gt;Why Now? (June 2018):&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing couldn’t be more perfect. I have the technology skills fresh in my mind from working and have been working on an education curriculum and methodology with a friend for the past 5 months. This curriculum involves including memory techniques to help students retain information for longer&lt;br&gt;
Phase 1, the high school mission trip to Guatemala, not only exceeded all of my expectations, but I was also able to successfully assess the need to return and carry out this trip. The medical clinic could use my assistance and I was able to learn about the technology education, or lack thereof, in Guatemala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="themission"&gt;The Mission&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teach&lt;/strong&gt;: I am partnering with local organizations to create a computer lab with the goal to bringing over 30 laptops (Donated from local organizations and friends) for students. As much as I would love to teach Guatemalan students directly, I believe it would be more effective and sustainable to teach Guatemalan teachers and professors. This will allow for consistent communication and minimize the risk for the teaching to be lost as students become adults. My goal is to teach the professors how to maintain the laptops as well as developing a curriculum that makes it easy for Guatemalan students to learn but also challenges them to learn more like the American college system did for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There currently aren't any working computer science education opportunities for the students in Guatemala.&lt;br&gt;
The government has a weekly program that is expensive and only provides students with 30-60min of computer time once a week!&lt;br&gt;
(No one can learn from so little computer time)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise behind this mission is to expose the Guatemalan students to programming and give them the opportunity and resources to learn. (Just like I was given in college)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serve&lt;/strong&gt;: I will implement a cloud based solution to synchronize patient records at the the medical clinic. Currently, there is nothing to connect the patient data from the clinic, laboratory, and pharmacy. I am hoping to use their internet and a software solution to connect the patient database.&lt;br&gt;
Also, I will also help translate for the Willow Creek Family Mission trip that will be there at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love&lt;/strong&gt;: When I am not teaching or working at the clinic, I will do everything I can to find extravagant ways to love the Guatemalans from the church community to my host family and evenyone in between. Again, Bob Goff says it best, &amp;quot;When we are fearlessly engaging with world with a child-like faith, it gives those around us the green light to do so too.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="implementation"&gt;Implementation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid the possibility of taxes, tariffs, confiscation, suspicion, or questioning from the Guatemalan customs (all possible outcomes from bringing one luggage full of laptops across international borders)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan is to distribute these laptops among the family mission trip members to get them across the border. An adult bringing 1-2 laptops shouldn't raise any eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once in Guatemala, laptops will be configured for their purpose.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;This trip kicks off on June 18, 2018.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="updates"&gt;Updates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First real work day. I finally witnessed some of the students put in some work. We carried blocks, sand, materials, and tools to each of the 16 houses. These blocks were used to build the bases of the chicken coops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some work memories (I'm sure everyone all contributed, but I was only able to capture so much of it)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hilly and Ethan at the house at the bottom of the hill.&lt;br&gt;
Yenny and Laziah had 2 houses right below our headquarters (which was were the little shop was located).&lt;br&gt;
Jeremy and Disch were putting in work on the first house on the hill above HQ.&lt;br&gt;
Lindsey and Cam were putting in work on a house right off the field.&lt;br&gt;
Elliot and Lilly were grinding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally spoke with Anna and Mattea today. They were the quieter ones of the group but they spoke to me!!!&lt;br&gt;
Anna is an absolute natural with the kids. It's amazing to witness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilly has a real passion for music. Her talent is incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id="paralosnios"&gt;Para Los Niños 🤗&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id="updates"&gt;Updates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First day in the Colonia de Flores. All 16 of the homes there were built by Willow Creek. Incredible work.&lt;br&gt;
The community was so welcoming and kind towards us; the outsiders, the foreigners.&lt;br&gt;
I felt like we not only looked, dressed, and acted differently; we also had a completely different sense of humor, upbringing, and way of life.&lt;br&gt;
Yet with all our differences we all spoke the language of love and service fluently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smiles were contagious&lt;br&gt;
Laughter was as incessant as the sun roasting us out there on that summer day. Sunburn was making its way into our group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We played soccer, duck-duck-goose, and tug-of-war with the community.&lt;br&gt;
Colin and I were rock stars and the Guatemalans were our biggest fans.&lt;br&gt;
For some reason there was a huge draw to get pictures with us...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our nightly worship was fun.&lt;br&gt;
(I personally think I can harmonize to an extent, but only if someone else sings the melody... but I don't know 🤷‍♂️... maybe I'm tone-deaf)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also had a blast at Axel's home.&lt;br&gt;
We basically picked up and played every instrument Axel owned and began playing it. ☺️&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Travel day from ORD -&amp;gt; GUA&lt;br&gt;
2 hour wait at airport, 5 hour flight non-stop.&lt;br&gt;
The group was quiet today. I learned about my roles as photographer for the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our translator / assistant, Lucy thought I was 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel comfortable and natural connecting with the students.&lt;br&gt;
Took a 3-4 hour bus ride from airport to Patzún that felt like eternity...&lt;br&gt;
22+ humans crammed into a steel box is not pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I somehow fell asleep to dogs barking incessantly...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="food"&gt;Food&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I instantly noticed that the portion sizes were WAY smaller.&lt;br&gt;
A local group was responsible for cooking, cleaning, and serving us meals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Information gathering - See where I can better help in Phase 2. Assess the technology they have and the current status of the students and resources there. Honestly assess if Phase 2 is even necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=""&gt;🙌&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Guatemala skit is ready to go (videos coming soon)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GUATEMALA IS IN 1 DAY!!!!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can walk well with my brace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=""&gt;🙏&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Guatemala is in 1 DAY....&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My knee survives a week without my ice machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No further injuries with the knee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overall health of the Guatemala team... E.coli is too common in the city we are going to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our team gets to know each other well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FTK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The students definitely connected well. I love them all ❤️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So many bonding experiences from the trip. Wow... 🙌&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;quot;skit&amp;quot; was an absolute flop 😂... no one really knew what was happening both in the church we went to and in our group. We didn't make it in time to attend the church service so by the time we got there we just performed our skit and left.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We &amp;quot;purelled&amp;quot; our hands so much so, that e.coli seemed like a myth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knee is recuperating well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There indeed is a need for me to return and help with my technology passion and experience! There really aren't any computer science opportunities in Patzun.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Knee was sore and achy afterwards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some pain upon weightbearing afterwards&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God of creation&lt;br&gt;
There at the start&lt;br&gt;
Before the beginning of time&lt;br&gt;
With no point of reference&lt;br&gt;
You spoke to the dark&lt;br&gt;
And fleshed out the wonder of light&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as You speak&lt;br&gt;
A hundred billion galaxies are born&lt;br&gt;
In the vapor of Your breath the planets form&lt;br&gt;
If the stars were made to worship so will I&lt;br&gt;
I can see Your heart in everything You’ve made&lt;br&gt;
Every burning star&lt;br&gt;
A signal fire of grace&lt;br&gt;
If creation sings Your praises so will I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God of Your promise&lt;br&gt;
You don’t speak in vain&lt;br&gt;
No syllable empty or void&lt;br&gt;
For once You have spoken&lt;br&gt;
All nature and science&lt;br&gt;
Follow the sound of Your voice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the stars were made to worship so will I&lt;br&gt;
If the mountains bow in reverence so will I&lt;br&gt;
If the oceans roar Your greatness so will I&lt;br&gt;
For if everything exists to lift You high so will I&lt;br&gt;
If the wind goes where You send it so will I&lt;br&gt;
If the rocks cry out in silence so will I&lt;br&gt;
If the sum of all our praises still falls shy&lt;br&gt;
Then we’ll sing again a hundred billion times&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God of salvation&lt;br&gt;
You chased down my heart&lt;br&gt;
Through all of my failure and pride&lt;br&gt;
On a hill You created&lt;br&gt;
The light of the world&lt;br&gt;
Abandoned in darkness to die&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as You speak&lt;br&gt;
A hundred billion failures disappear&lt;br&gt;
Where You lost Your life so I could find it here&lt;br&gt;
If You left the grave behind You so will I&lt;br&gt;
I can see Your heart in everything You’ve done&lt;br&gt;
Every part designed in a work of art called love&lt;br&gt;
If You gladly chose surrender so will I&lt;br&gt;
I can see Your heart&lt;br&gt;
Eight billion different ways&lt;br&gt;
Every precious one&lt;br&gt;
A child You died to save&lt;br&gt;
If You gave Your life to love them so will I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like You would again a hundred billion times&lt;br&gt;
But what measure could amount to Your desire&lt;br&gt;
You’re the One who never leaves the one behind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beginning of this song reminds of &lt;code&gt;GENESIS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the beginning of time&lt;br&gt;
With no point of reference&lt;br&gt;
You spoke to the dark&lt;br&gt;
And fleshed out the wonder of light&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This verse reminds me of God breathing &amp;quot;LET THERE BE LIGHT&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the stars were made to worship so will I&lt;br&gt;
If the mountains bow in reverence so will I&lt;br&gt;
If the oceans roar Your greatness so will I&lt;br&gt;
If the wind goes where You send it so will I&lt;br&gt;
If the rocks cry out in silence so will I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These words remind of God's grandeur. Words that describe the feeling you get when you're on top of a mountain and look out and just see the beauty of the earth or when you witness a sunset that is out of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God of salvation&lt;br&gt;
You chased down my heart&lt;br&gt;
Through all of my failure and pride&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lyric reminds me of John 16:33 because failure and pride are in EVERYONE and God pursues us through all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.”&lt;br&gt;
John 16:33&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my favorite part of the song:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as You speak&lt;br&gt;
A hundred billion failures disappear&lt;br&gt;
Where You lost Your life so I could find it here&lt;br&gt;
If You left the grave behind You so will I&lt;br&gt;
I can see Your heart in everything You’ve done&lt;br&gt;
Every part designed in a work of art called love&lt;br&gt;
If You gladly chose surrender so will I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this part because it wraps up the song with the cross.&lt;br&gt;
Beginning with Genesis and ending with the heart of the gospel, His sacrifice.&lt;br&gt;
I love how when God speaks, &amp;quot;100B failures disappear&amp;quot;. This makes me think that God doesn't see life as failures nor successes.&lt;br&gt;
The word &amp;quot;SUCCESS&amp;quot; is such an earthly and temporary term. There is no eternal value in that word.&lt;br&gt;
But God leaving the grave &lt;strong&gt;is eternal&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Since God chose &lt;strong&gt;surrender&lt;/strong&gt; and left the grave then so will I.&lt;br&gt;
Leaving my grave is definitely eternal.&lt;br&gt;
And just like RECKLESS LOVE:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re the One who never leaves the one behind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God's relentless pursuit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God&lt;br&gt;
Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine&lt;br&gt;
There's no shadow You won't light up&lt;br&gt;
Mountain You won't climb up&lt;br&gt;
Coming after me&lt;br&gt;
There's no wall You won't kick down&lt;br&gt;
Lie You won't tear down&lt;br&gt;
Coming after me&lt;br&gt;
-RECKLESS LOVE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I've seen You move, come move the mountains&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stumbled upon this amazing post by my man Steven Furtick...&lt;br&gt;
The 👨‍💻 in  me really resonates with the analogy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The cross is my operating system&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything I do goes through my operating system...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every thought or idea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every breath&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every decision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every dream&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been nearly a month since I exercised or broke a sweat... And losing the ability to move like I used to / like I want to has been the most mentally straining part of this rehab.&lt;br&gt;
Neuroscientifically speaking, there are so many benefits to incorporating exercise into one's life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stress / anxiety relief, endorphin-release&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhanced brain plasticity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhanced learning and memory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New neurons, and longer lived neurons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved mood and sleep&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't believe me check out these sources:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/regular-exercise-changes-brain-improve-memory-thinking-skills-201404097110"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.brainhq.com/brain-resources/everyday-brain-fitness/physical-exercise"&gt;BrainHQ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-claudia-aguirre/your-brain-on-exercise_b_7066856.html"&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/your-brain-exercise"&gt;University of California&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.myfitnesspal.com/this-is-your-brain-on-exercise/"&gt;MyFitnessPal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And so this lack of exercise has really got me feeling some type of way (basically a lack of all those benefits above^)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, today my therapist asked me to hold plank &amp;quot;as long as you can&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;
AND I THOUGHT - &amp;quot;CHALLENGE ACCEPTED!&amp;quot; while hesitant if I could even go for a minute... 💥&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;4:00 Plank&lt;/code&gt;... BIG WIN. FIRST TAKE. ONE-N-DONE. Here I thought I was weak and here God was like &amp;quot;boy, please... watch me work&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
(Also, I lowkey think that the plank is less a measure of one's physical strength and more of one's mental toughness... but maybe that's just me🤷‍♂️)&lt;br&gt;
Finally broke a sweat today 😅☺️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=""&gt;💪&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PT Day 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CPM still at 90ª&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increasing usage of leg: adding new exercises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single leg balance, plank, pushups, hammie curls, gastroc raises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=""&gt;🙌&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm still alive and kicking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very grateful for the educational opportunities I have received throughout my life... I took school for granted because... well HW. Now I see how much of a blessing it is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Family friends are calling me up to help with tech, babysitting, and tutoring. It's nice to be utilized in this time of physical pain and mental turmoil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can finally shower without saran wrap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=""&gt;🙏&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serve the high schoolers #FTK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased productivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patience with fam and students I tutor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More prayer throughout my days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;My mind wants to do more than my body can do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can't let physical weakness translate to mental weakness. I can still think clearly, focus, and problem solve... so what's holding me back?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need to learn to use this &amp;quot;waiting time&amp;quot; to the fullest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🤔&lt;em&gt;What's something I can't do that I would do if I were healthy?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;PT Evaluation today; my protocol is above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing new... assess pain levels, goals of PT, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait; wait; and more waiting... This rehab doesn't &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; start until the stitching is strong (Weeks 4-6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fully locked brace until week 6ish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My quad strength is definitely coming back faster than ACL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't go past 90º with CPM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=""&gt;🙌&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Parents who always refill my gameready ice machine with fresh ice ❄️&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I am a good role model for the high school boys (sophomores) in the small group I co-lead.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost looking like my good side:&lt;br&gt;

The injured leg is finally starting to feel like it's mine again. I am finally regaining ownership of that leg again.&lt;br&gt;
It is finally moving, behaving like I want it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But honestly, are these bodies really ours to claim???&lt;br&gt;
Or are they merely blessings, gifts, vessels that have been given to us...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="updates"&gt;Updates:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walking with brace is 🍰&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CPM cranked up to 90º because I can&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continually improving quad strength&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=""&gt;🙌&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This time in life to rest and recover and really relax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thankful for healthy eyes, hearing, breathing, smelling, and sense of touch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The way God puts people in your life just at the right time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=""&gt;🙏&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better sleep, my body is waking up way too early because of achy knee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love my parents better, especially while I am at home&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allergy doctors respond to my cries of help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1482164565953-04b62dcac1cd?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=1080&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjExNzczfQ&amp;s=7c20d1d9c89d3b0412c0062fb87605d4" alt="Manos a la Obra (de Cristo)"&gt;&lt;p&gt;La frase &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;manos a la obra&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; es remangarnos las mangas Y ponernos a trabajar de principio a fin por una determinada o causa.&lt;br&gt;
Al expresar esta frase demostramos no sólo compromiso, sino, entrega de nosotros mismos, no dejaremos el proyecto incompleto; ni a la gente trabajando sola.&lt;br&gt;
Si una persona que cumple con sus compromisos es considerada valiosa. Cuanto aún más los hijos de Dios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nuestro caso como cristianos, &lt;strong&gt;¿en donde vamos a poner manos a la obra?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Obviamente en los asuntos de Jesús, es decir, en “la obra de Dios”, pero no podemos hacerla solo dentro de la iglesia, aquí ya todos somos salvos.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;“Sabemos que somos de Dios, y el mundo entero está bajo el maligno.”&lt;/strong&gt; (1 Juan 5:19)&lt;br&gt;
Cristo quiere que nuestro cristianismo los reflejemos fuera de estas cuatro paredes; en el mundo, en lo secular, Adonde no hay esperanza, a donde no hay amor, adonde el egoísmo, La vanidad y la perversión abundan, porque ahora este es el dominio de Satanás.&lt;br&gt;
Para esto es importante, no sólo &lt;strong&gt;saber&lt;/strong&gt; y &lt;strong&gt;conocer&lt;/strong&gt; de Dios, sino, también &lt;strong&gt;hacerla&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Saber&lt;/strong&gt; es sólo una función mental respecto a nuestra salvación, &lt;strong&gt;conocer&lt;/strong&gt; se obtiene por el meditar en la palabra de Dios; pero el &lt;strong&gt;hacer&lt;/strong&gt;, implica esa Palabra; Y requiere voluntad, compromiso y entrega en el diario caminar el Señor cumpliendo sus mandatos.&lt;br&gt;
Debemos poner manos a la obra en el servicio a Cristo, &lt;strong&gt;“La mies es mucha y los trabajadores son pocos”&lt;/strong&gt; (Mateo 9:37), pero somos pocos, porque le huimos el compromiso, sentimos que no estamos listos para trabajar para Dios. Nos detenemos a meditar en dónde enfocar nuestras prioridades y dejamos al final lo más importante. &lt;strong&gt;Y mientras tanto “Las almas perdidas van como ovejas al matadero”&lt;/strong&gt; (Romanos 8:36)&lt;br&gt;
Tenemos &lt;strong&gt;todo&lt;/strong&gt; para servir a aquel que nos salvó de ir al matadero; &lt;strong&gt;Tenemos una vida, una Biblia, y el Espíritu Santo de Dios&lt;/strong&gt; dentro; para que actúe y hable por nosotros a donde quiera que vayamos.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;¡Así que manos a la obra!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puntos del Mensaje&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aceptar el reto de salir y hablar del amor del Cristo require amor, esfuerzo, y compromiso.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salir al mundo es bueno pero solo si estas entrenado para ser Sal y Luz el la oscuridad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;El Espíritu Santo de Dios y la Palabra de Dios son nuestra protección Divina.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id="anlisisdelservicio"&gt;Análisis del Servicio&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En primer lugar, la adoración fue increíble. Me encanta cantar en español. No se por qué, pero me siento algo poderoso.&lt;br&gt;
La única cancion que reconocí era &amp;quot;Reinas por Eternidad&amp;quot; de Hillsong (Forever Reign)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La letra es tan hermosa&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bueno es Dios, Bueno es Dios&lt;br&gt;
Cuando nada hay bueno en mí&lt;br&gt;
Tu amor, Tu amor&lt;br&gt;
No se puede resistir&lt;br&gt;
Eres luz, Eres luz&lt;br&gt;
Aun en la oscuridad&lt;br&gt;
Eres fiel, Eres fiel&lt;br&gt;
Has borrado mi maldad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eres paz, Eres paz&lt;br&gt;
Aun en medio del temor&lt;br&gt;
La verdad, La verdad&lt;br&gt;
Cuando ando en confusión&lt;br&gt;
La razón, La razón&lt;br&gt;
De mi gozo está en Jesús&lt;br&gt;
El venció, El venció&lt;br&gt;
A la muerte en la cruz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tú me abrazas con tu amor&lt;br&gt;
Me abrazas con tu amor&lt;br&gt;
Tu gracia me encontró&lt;br&gt;
Cambió mi corazón&lt;br&gt;
Nada se puede comparar&lt;br&gt;
Reinas por la eternidad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eres más, Eres más&lt;br&gt;
De lo que puedo expresar&lt;br&gt;
Eres Rey, Eres Rey&lt;br&gt;
La creación proclamará&lt;br&gt;
Aquí estás, Aquí estás&lt;br&gt;
Tu presencia es real&lt;br&gt;
Eres Dios, Eres Dios&lt;br&gt;
Lo pasado dejo atrás&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mi corazón&lt;br&gt;
Te cantará&lt;br&gt;
Jesús&lt;br&gt;
Jesús&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Por lo general, el servicio fue un poco aburrido.&lt;br&gt;
No había chistes o bromas durante el sermón. (no es una necesidad, pero sentía como si hubiera asistado a una clase... con una diapositiva de PowerPoint también)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En mi opinión, ella habló tantas palabras sobre poco contenido. El sermón me dio nada nuevo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Los puntos del mensaje eran básicos y ella no nos proporcionó con una aplicación del mundo real.&lt;br&gt;
... pues no nos quedamos por la duración del servicio.&lt;br&gt;
Es posible que haya más información y una aplicación del mundo real pero nunca lo sabremos...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;CPM up to 75º since day 5 has been so boring&lt;/li&gt;
